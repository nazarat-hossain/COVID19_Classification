# COVID19_Classification


#### COVID-19 pandemic quickly spreads around the world because asymptomatic individuals play a large role in transmitting the disease. As such, the early testing of COVID-19 is important to break the chain of infection. RT-PCR (Gold standard) test is a very common scientific technique widely used in COVID-19 detection. However, RT-PCR test is a time-consuming technical process and not suitable for scale the test. In addition, trained lab technician and biosafety level 2+ lab are necessary. To mitigate the inefficiency and shortage of resources, the effective Deep Learning technique is proposed to diagnose COVID-19 based on CT images. Convolutional Neural Network Models with different number of layers are used to classify COVID-19 CT Scan Images. Among them Resnet-18 CNN performs better with the recall of 94% and accuracy of 94.7%.
